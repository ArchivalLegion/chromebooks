==================
GNOME3 Rootfs Demo
==================

This is the rootfs used by default to build the images for the Chromebooks. The main purpose of this rootfs is show current support in mainline for different boards. The demo runs a `Debian` based image with GNOME3 and accelerated graphics when possible.

The `Debian` images are assembled using the `debos <http://github.com/go-debos/debos>`_ utility, which uses the `Debian` package feed beneath. Stuff not available in official `Debian` packages will be built from sources or downloaded into the final image.

The Debian way to build the demo rootfs
=======================================

.. include:: install-debos-on-debian.rst

Now that debos is installed, letâ€™s create the demos images, run:

.. code-block:: sh

  Export the architecture of your device (arm or arm64 or amd64):

  $ export architecture=arm64

  And then run:

  $ $GOPATH/bin/debos -m 4G -t architecture:$architecture tools/debos/images/gnome-desktop/gnome-desktop.yaml

Will create the following output:

- debian-gnome-desktop-sid-$architecture.tar.gz, a tarball with the Debian GNOME3 based filesystem.

After that, to create an image run (**note** this is only supported for arm and arm64 architectures):

.. code-block:: sh

  $ $GOPATH/bin/debos -m 4G -t architecture:$architecture tools/debos/images/gnome-desktop/chromebook-image.yaml

Will create the following output:

- debian-gnome-desktop-sid-$architecture.img.gz, a gz-compressed image file for a Chromebook.
- debian-gnome-desktop-sid-$architecture.img.gz.md5, the image checksum.
- debian-gnome-desktop-sid-$architecture.img.bmap, a bitmap summary for faster flashing via bmaptools.

To flash it, assuming your SD card is /dev/mmcblk0, use:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ bmaptool copy debian-gnome-desktop-sid-$architecture.img.gz /dev/mmcblk0

The bmap file is automatically looked for in the current directory.

Note that the credentials to login are debian:debian.
